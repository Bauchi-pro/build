!! this is destructive to data already resident in your postgres instance.
!  you need to have run migrations to set up the schema before running this.

the order of operations here:
1. run the dump_data.rb script, with the only argument being the directory
   wherein the database files reside.
   !! for best results, pass a quoted absolute path as the argument.
2. this will generate a trio of CSV files and a .sql file.
3. feed the generated .sql file to postgres. you'll find in the same directory as your tokyo databases.
  * if you're feeling wary, you can do this by copy+pasting the lines into an interactive session one at a time.
  * or you can do something like:
    psql -d odkbuild -a -f load_data.sql
